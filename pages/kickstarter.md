**Overview:**  
Kickstarter, founded in 2009, is a crowdfunding platform where project creators can raise money from the public, circumventing traditional avenues of investment. It has an all-or-nothing funding model, whereby a project is only funded if it meets its goal amount; otherwise no money is given by backers to a project.

A huge variety of factors contribute to the success or failure of a project on Kickstarter. Some of these factors are able to be quantified or categorized, which allows machine learning models to predict whether a project will succeed or not.

The goal of this project is to predict if a Kickstart project will succeed or fail through using Exploratory Data Analysis and supervised Machine Learning models.

More generally, the aim is to help potential project creators as well as potential investors assess what their chances of success on Kickstarter will be.

**Language used:** Python
