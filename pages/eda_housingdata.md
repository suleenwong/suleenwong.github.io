**Overview:**  
The goal in this project was to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on the King County housing data set and to come up with a few potential homes in King County, Washingston that fit the requirements of an imaginary stakeholder, Zachary Brooks. 

Zachary Brooks invests in historical homes in the best neighborhoods, seeking to make high profits within a time frame of a year. He wants to know if the houses he purchases should be renovated to increase his final resale price.
