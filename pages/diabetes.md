<span style="color:darkgrey;">June 2022 &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; Su Leen Wong</span>


**Overview:**  
The goal of this project is to predict using machine learning whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 

The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.


**Language used:** Python

**Applied tools:**  
<span style="color:grey">Pandas:</span> data handling  
<span style="color:grey">Matplotlib:</span> data visualization  
<span style="color:grey">Seaborn:</span> data visualization  
<span style="color:grey">Scikit-learn:</span> machine learning model
